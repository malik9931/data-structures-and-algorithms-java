# Code Challenge: Class 32
### Challenge Summary
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

### Challenge Description
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

tree_intersection(tree.BinaryTree tree1 , tree.BinaryTree tree2)

### Approach & Efficiency

* Given 2 Binary Trees:
    * Traverse throw the trees -> 2 equal arrays of numbers 
    * loop throw the 2 arrays
    * checking if the which elements will be equal
        * yes -> add it to an now List
        * no -> keep looping
