# Hashtable and The Code Challenge Solutions
The following four methods in the [class Hashtable](../hashtable) have a Time Complexity of O(1), and a Space Complexity of O(1):


* add()
    * Takes in both the key and value. This method hashes the key, and adds the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get()
    * Takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains()
    * Takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash()
    * Takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
