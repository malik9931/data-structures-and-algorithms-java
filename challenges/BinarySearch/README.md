# Binary Search
Binary search in a sorted 1D array


## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
I was using the Binary search Algorithim, by instializing a variable for mid index ,first and last index.
Then make a loop throw whole of the sorted array, and compare the midlle elment with key.
