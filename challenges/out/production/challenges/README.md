# Fibonacci Number
Generate the nth Fibonacci number, 2 different ways.

## Challenge
write a function to accepts an integer, and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Approach & Efficiency
I was using 2 ways to find the Fibonacci number in its sequance, the 1st one depending on reresion, the 2nd one depending one itiration.
Both of the ways are going throw a function to start a summation from the first two elements in the sequance which started with (0 , 1) then assign a values for the other elements after it.
Finally it Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
